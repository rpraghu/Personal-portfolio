            <p> With a solid foundation in Mechanical Engineering backed by a 73.1% score from Vidyavardhaka College Of Engineering, I am deeply enthusiastic about the convergence of traditional engineering practices with cutting-edge technology, particularly Additive Manufacturing.
              <br><br>My exposure to Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printing technology at VVCE's Skill Development Center and my involvement in the SAE Baa Collegiate Design Series are testimonies to my hands-on experience and collaborative work ethic.

<br><br>During my academic journey, I also delved into the world of software, completing the 'Python for Everybody' course from the prestigious University of Michigan. My foundational knowledge in programming languages like C++, Python, HTML, and CSS, combined with tools like Solid Edge, paves the way for interdisciplinary applications.

<br><br>Beyond the technical realm, my leadership roles as a Class Representative and a member of IUCEE, paired with attributes such as adaptability, teamwork, and self-motivation, enable me to tackle challenges head-on and contribute effectively in diverse teams.

<br><br>In my recent project, I developed a personal portfolio that showcases my skills, achievements, and experiences, reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
<br><br>Our  development of a Solar Powered Pesticide Sprayer, designed to assist farmers in spraying pesticides on their crops more efficiently and with less effort compared to traditional methods.
<br><br>I am always eager to connect with professionals and peers who share my passion for innovation and progress. Let's exchange ideas and drive the future of Mechanical Engineering and Software Technology together.
